            <h2>Cave In</h2>
            <p>
                [Verse 1]
            Please take a long hard look
            Through your text book, cause I'm history
            When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone
            'Cause I've been dying to leave
            Yeah, I'll ride the range
            And hide all my loose change in my bedroll
            'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike
            Always takes its toll on me
            I've had just about enough
            Of quote diamonds in the rough
            Because my backbone is paper thin
            </p>
            <p>
                [Chorus]
                Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
                (I'll cave in, I'll cave in)    
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 2]
                If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
                (The sun will still be shining)
                Because I've heard it said that
                Every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
                (Though I'm always undermining too deep to know)
                Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
                'Cause the road tastes like Wintergreen
                The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
                Mixed with stale gasoline
                I'll soak up the sound
                Try to sleep on the wet ground
                I'll get ten minutes give or take
                'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
                When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
                (Awake, awake, awake, awake...)    
            </p> 
            <p>
                [Chorus]
                Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
                (Cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in...)
                Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
                
            </p>
            <p>[Verse 3]
                 I'll keep my helmet on
                Just in case my head caves in
                (In case my head caves in)
                'Cause if my thoughts collapse
                 Or my framework snaps
                 It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe
                 Tie my handlebars to the stars
                 So I stay on track (so I stay on track)
                And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
                Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back
           </p>
            <p>[Outro]
                I won't even look back
                (Da da da da da da da da da da
                Da da da da da da da daaa...)</p>

            <h2>The Bird And The Worm</h2>
            <p>
                [Verse 1]
                If you're the bird
                Whenever we pretend it's summer
                Then I'm the worm
                I know the part, it's such a bummer
                But fair is fair
                If my segments get separated
                I'll scream
                And you'll be there
                Close your eyes
                (Close my eyes)
                Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
                And feel the shine
                (Feel the shine)
                I'm hooked so toss me over
                And cast the line
                (Well, I'll try)
                I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
                (It depends)
                As they arrive
                (If they arrive)                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Chorus]
                You and I left our troubles far behind
                (Troubles far behind)
                But I still have just one more question on my mind
                For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
                With friends like these, well
                Who needs enemies?
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 2]
                If I'm your boy
                Let's take a shortcut we remember
                And we'll enjoy
                Picking apples in late September like
                We've done for years
                Then we'll take a long walk
                Through the cornfield
                And I'll kiss you
                Between the ears
                If you're my girl
                Swirl me around your room with feeling
                And as we twirl
                The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
                Will shine for us
                As love sweeps over the room
                Because we tend to make
                Each other blush
                (You make me blush)
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Chorus]
                You and I left our troubles far behind
                (Troubles far behind)
                But I still have just one more question on my mind
                For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
                With fronds like these, well
                Who needs anemones?
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Outro]
                You're the bird, I'm the worm
                And it's plain to see
                That we were meant to be
                We were meant to be
                We were meant to be
                If you're the bird
                If you're the bird
                Then I'm the worm
                We were meant to be

            <p>
                [Verse 1]
                Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
                In the hills and highlands
                I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
                And awake in your mouth
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 2]
                Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
                Deep beneath the blue waves
                I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
                And construct a summer home
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 3]
                Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
                Shining down on your face
                I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
                And descend inside of you
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 4]
                Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
                Feeling warm in your sand
                I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
                Rolling in the evening breeze
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 5]
                Hello Seattle, I am an albatross
                On the docks and moored boats
                I sail above your inlets and interstates
                Through the rain and open wind
                
            </p>
            <p>
                [Verse 6]
                Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
                Throwing beams of bright light
                Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
                Taking heed for everyone

Carry me though the night (I am a mountaineer, in the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital)
Sing me to sleep tonight (Parking lots)
